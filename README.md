## Web Search Engine for Retrieval-Augmented Generation

This project aims to develop a scalable and efficient web search engine to support Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The search engine is designed with a modular architecture that allows for easy integration of different indexing and tokenization strategies. Currently it has undergone significant performance optimizations, achieving a 10x speed boost in the indexing process.

QUERY: Descirbe DSCT Major from HKUST

ANSWER:
The Data Science and Technology (DSCT) major at HKUST is a program that offers a comprehensive curriculum
covering areas such as machine learning, classification, clustering, data mining, database management,
cloud computing, and data visualization. The program is ranked highly in various fields, including:
- #32 in Computer Science and Information Systems (No.1 in Hong Kong)
- #43 in Statistics and Operational Research (No.1 in Hong Kong)
- #47 in Mathematics (No.1 in Hong Kong)
Graduates of the DSCT major are in high demand in today's job market, with career opportunities in sectors
such as IT, engineering, finance, management, sales, and more. Students pursuing an additional major within
the DSCT program have specific requirements to fulfill, including completing certain math and computer
science courses with specific grade requirements. The program also offers opportunities for students to
complete an additional major program with the approval of the relevant major-program coordinators, with
the first major being the degree associated with the student's transcript.
